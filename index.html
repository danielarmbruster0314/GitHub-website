                    <h3>A brief synopsis</h3>
                    <p>I am a nerd who is obsessed with the concept of personal growth. I aspire to be just 1% better than I was yesterday and programming seems to be something that challenges me to think about problems in different ways and I am all for it. Some big intrests of mine would be the gym, anime, and videogames.</p>

            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about"></p>

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I have an associates of arts, after a massive escapade of trial and tribulation trying to discover what I gravitated to most for a potential life career. Throughout my college experience I tried accounting, business, economics, music, and finally art. I was on the search for something that could allow me to have creative expression as well as challenge my pragmatic thinking skills, or rather an activity that was both fun and boring wrapped into a complex sandwich. After I got my associates degree I fled to Alaska for 4 months raising and training sled dogs for the 2019 Yukon quest winner Brent Sas, and I'm sure if you havenâ€™t heard me talk about it you probably will at some point. This was a wild experience that was a big eureka moment in my life. It really changed my perspective on my capabilities as an individual. After I returned from Alaska I was a bit lost and found a wonderful resource called Codecademy where I wrote my first line of code and something about it just clicked. So just like a majority of things that I hyperfixate on I plan to ride the wave and see where it leads. I would love to land a job at FANG, however landing any job in the tech industry seems like a golden ticket, the opportunity to grow and learn in this space is just too enticing.</p>
